# Pixel-Manipulation-for-Image-Encryption

**Image Encryption Tool**

A Simple Image Encryption Tool using Pixel Manipulation with Python

**Overview**

This project provides a simple image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation to encrypt and decrypt images. The tool uses a basic mathematical operation (addition and subtraction) on each pixel to encrypt and decrypt the image.

**Requirements**
+ Python 3.x
+ Pillow (PIL fork)

**Installation**

Install the required packages using pip:
`pip install pillow`

**Usage**
+ Run the script using Python:
`python image_encryption.py`
+ Follow the prompts to choose whether to encrypt or decrypt an image.
+ Enter the file path of the image to encrypt or the encrypted image to decrypt.
+ Enter the encryption or decryption key as an integer value.
